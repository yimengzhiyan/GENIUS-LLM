### **Final Analysis**:
Based on the data for the target gene and related genes, predict the biological function of gene '{gene_id}' and its possible involvement in specific traits. Your explanation should include:

#### **1. Predicted Function**:
- Provide a concise and clear statement summarizing the predicted biological function of gene '{gene_id}'.

#### **2. Supporting Evidence**:
- Present a structured explanation of the reasoning behind your prediction. Include data and insights from:
  - **BLAST Similarity Data**: Analyze evolutionary relationships or functional similarities.
  - **Co-expression Data**: Highlight involvement in shared pathways.
  - **Gene Expression Patterns**: Determine tissue-specific roles and biological significance.
  - **Homologous Gene Functions**: Leverage conserved functionalities across species.
  - **TWAS Data**: Link gene expression to specific traits or phenotypes.
- Clearly highlight upregulation/downregulation trends across tissues, explaining their relevance to the gene's biological roles.

#### **3. Potential Traits**:
- List and describe any traits that may be influenced by gene '{gene_id}', integrating evidence from the above datasets.


#### **4. Upregulation/Downregulation Analysis**:
- Use gene expression data to analyze whether gene '{gene_id}' is upregulated or downregulated under specific conditions.
- Correlate observed trends with potential biological roles, e.g.:
  - **Upregulation**: Active involvement in processes like stress response or development.
  - **Downregulation**: Reduced activity or suppression in certain pathways or conditions.
- Cross-reference local findings with external annotations (e.g., GO terms, KEGG pathways).
  
#### **5. Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
- Provide a structured explanation showing how each dataset contributes to your prediction. Use logical connectors like "Firstly," "Furthermore," and "Lastly" for clarity.

### **Task Overview**:
You are tasked with predicting the biological function of the target gene '{gene_id}' by analyzing multiple datasets. Use the following datasets in order of priority to infer the gene's function, associated biological processes, and relevant traits. To strengthen the prediction, integrate evidence from **all available data sources** where possible, even if high-priority data already suggests a strong hypothesis.


### **Data for Target Gene '{gene_id}'**:
- For each supporting evidence type (e.g., BLAST, co-expression, expression data), all need to be supplemented with external data:
#### Data Sources (Ordered by Priority):
1. **TWAS Data** (High Confidence):
   - **Purpose**: Directly associate the gene with specific traits via statistical associations. High Z-scores indicate stronger associations.
   - **Usage**: TWAS associations take precedence and form the initial basis of predictions. However, use other datasets to validate and enhance confidence in TWAS-based associations.
   - Use external KEGG pathways or STRING interactions to explain observed trait associations.
   - Example: "KEGG: Pathway 'Secondary Metabolite Biosynthesis' suggests the gene is involved in cotton's fiber strength."

2. **Homologous Gene Data** (Medium-High Confidence):
   - **Purpose**: Use homologous gene functions in model organisms to support functional predictions.
   - **Usage**: Homologous gene data can strengthen TWAS predictions or provide standalone insights in the absence of TWAS. When TWAS and homologous data are aligned, continue to examine additional datasets to add support and detail.

3. **Expression Data** (Medium Confidence):
   - **Purpose**: Confirm tissue or stage-specific gene activity to validate primary predictions.
   - **Usage**: Use high or specific expression to validate TWAS and homolog predictions. Continue this validation with other data sources to form a well-supported hypothesis.
   - Validate tissue-specific expression trends using external studies or databases.

4. **BLAST Similarity Data** (Supporting Confidence):
   - **Purpose**: Identify sequence similarities with other genes to suggest functional parallels.
   - **Usage**: Utilize BLAST data to indirectly reinforce predictions from TWAS, expression, or homologous gene data. Use it as an additional layer of support, especially in stress tolerance or pathway functions.
   - Include functional annotations of homologous genes retrieved from GO, KEGG, or PubMed.
   - Example: "Gene 'Ghir_D11G004620' with 97.829% similarity is annotated in GO as 'GO:0009507 (photosynthesis).' Retrieved from Gene Ontology database."

5. **Co-expression Data** (Supporting Confidence):
   - **Purpose**: Explore functional associations through co-expression with genes of known functions.
   - **Usage**: Co-expression data serves as further validation, especially when corroborating TWAS and expression data findings. Use co-expression to suggest pathway involvement or related functions when other data sources are weak.

6. **GO Data** (High Confidence):
   - **Purpose**: Use provided GO annotations to identify biological processes, molecular functions, or cellular components associated with the gene.
   - **Usage**: GO annotations directly support functional roles of the gene based on provided data.

7. **KEGG Pathway Data** (High Confidence):
   - **Purpose**: Use provided KEGG pathways to describe metabolic or regulatory pathways involving the gene.
   - **Usage**: KEGG pathways contextualize gene function in broader biochemical networks or stress responses.

### **Inference Paths for Gene '{gene_id}'**:
Follow these paths based on available data, using each source as evidence to confirm or elaborate predictions. Integrate multiple paths when they reinforce each other, and continue gathering support from all relevant data types even after forming initial predictions.

- **Path 1** (Direct TWAS Association): If TWAS data shows a strong association, form a primary hypothesis. Validate with expression data to identify tissue-specific activity, focusing on whether the gene is upregulated or downregulated in relevant tissues or conditions. Use homolog data to refine these predictions.Note: Information from web-searched papers should not be included in the output.
